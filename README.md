## :open_book: About 
Project made in React with Typescript as a refactor of my old class based React Calculator.

RPN Calculator system differs a little bit from algebraic system, in RPN we input the values before the operation. There's no '=' key like algebraic calculator. RPN system improve the usability of the calculator and make very easy to type longer expressions.

[RPN Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation)

### Order of input keys in both systems:

Algebraic              | RPN
-----------            | -----------
1 + 2 =                | 1 ↵   2 +
2 + 3 * 4 =            | 3 ↵   4 *   2 +  
( 2 + 2 ) * (1 + 1) =  | 2 ↵   2 +   1 ↵   1 +  *
